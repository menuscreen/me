# Ubuntu Server Hardening

This repository contains scripts and guidelines for hardening an Ubuntu Server. Hardening refers to the process of securing a system by reducing its surface of vulnerability. Improve the overall security of Ubuntu Server and reduce the risk of successful cyber attacks using various aspects of server security such as:

* [User account management](#user-account-managment)
* [Network security](#network-security)
* [Firewall configuration](#firewall-configuration)
* [System updates and patches](#system-updates-and-patches)
* [File system permissions](#file-system-permissions)
* [Logging and monitoring](#logging-and-monitoring)

## User Account Managment

**Audit:**  
Verify that the Ubuntu operating system expires temporary user accounts within 72 hours or less.

```bash
sudo chage -l <system_account_name> | grep expires
```

**Fix:**
```bash
sudo chage -E $(date -d "+3 days" +%F) system_account_name
```

**Audit:**  
Verify the Ubuntu operating system has the "vlock" package installed by running the following command:

```bash
dpkg -l | grep vlock
```

**Fix:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install vlock
```

**Audit:**  
Verify the Ubuntu operating system enforces a 24 hours/1 day minimum password lifetime for new user accounts by running the following command:

```bash
grep -i ^pass_min_days /etc/login.defs
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/login.defs" file:
PASS_MIN_DAYS 1
```

**Audit:**  
Verify the Ubuntu operating system enforces a 60-day maximum password lifetime for new user accounts by running the following command:

```bash
grep -i ^pass_max_days /etc/login.defs
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Add or modify the following line in the "/etc/login.defs" file:
PASS_MAX_DAYS 60
```

**Audit:**  
Run the following command to verify the encrypted password is set:

```bash
sudo grep -i password /boot/grub/grub.cfg
# root password entry should begin with "password_pbkdf2"
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Generate an encrypted (grub) password for root with the following command:
grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2

# Using the hash from the output, modify the "/etc/grub.d/40_custom" file with the following command to add a boot password:
sudo sed -i '$i set superusers=\"root\"\npassword_pbkdf2 root <hash>' /etc/grub.d/40_custom
# where <hash> is the hash generated by grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 command

# Generate an updated "grub.conf" file with the new password by using the following command:
sudo update-grub
```

**Audit:**  
Verify the Ubuntu operating system contains no duplicate User IDs (UIDs) for interactive users with the following command:

```bash
awk -F ":" 'list[$3]++{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd
```

**Fix:**  
> Edit the file "/etc/passwd" and provide each interactive user account that has a duplicate UID with a unique UID.

**Audit:**  
Verify the sudo group has only members who should have access to security functions.

```bash
grep sudo /etc/group
```

**Fix:**  
```bash
# To remove a user from the sudo group, run:
sudo gpasswd -d <username> sudo
```

**Audit:**  
Verify the operating system automatically terminates a user session after inactivity timeouts have expired.

```bash
grep -E "\bTMOUT=[0-9]+" /etc/bash.bashrc /etc/profile.d/*

```

**Fix:** 
> If "TMOUT" is not set, or if the value is "0" or is commented out,
create the file "/etc/profile.d/99-terminal_tmout.sh" file if it does not exist.
```bash
# Modify or append the following line in the "/etc/profile.d/99-terminal_tmout.sh " file:
TMOUT=600
# This will set a timeout value of 10 minutes for all future sessions.

# set the timeout for the current sessions
export TMOUT=600
```

**Audit:**  
Verify the "/etc/sudoers" file has no occurrences of "NOPASSWD" or "!authenticate" by running the following command:

```bash
sudo egrep -i '(nopasswd|!authenticate)' /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d/*
```

**Fix:**
> Remove any occurrence of "NOPASSWD" or "!authenticate" found in "/etc/sudoers" file or files in the "/etc/sudoers.d" directory.

## Network security

**Audit:**  
Verify the Ubuntu operating system is configured to use strong authenticators in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic maintenance.

```bash
# Verify that "UsePAM" is set to "yes" in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config:
grep -r ^UsePAM /etc/ssh/sshd_config*
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Add or modify the following line to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:
UsePAM yes
```

**Audit:**  
Configure the Ubuntu operating system to automatically terminate inactive SSH sessions after a period of inactivity.

```bash
# Verify the "ClientAliveCountMax" variable is set in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file by performing the following command:
sudo grep -ir clientalivecountmax /etc/ssh/sshd_config*
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# If "ClientAliveCountMax" is not set, is not set to "1", or is commented out, Modify or append the following line in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file, replacing "[Count]" with a value of 1:
ClientAliveCountMax 1

# Restart the SSH daemon for the changes to take effect:
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
```

**Audit:**  
Verify that all network connections associated with SSH traffic are automatically terminated at the end of the session or after 10 minutes of inactivity.

```bash
# Verify the "ClientAliveInterval" variable is set to a value of "600" or less by performing the following command:
sudo grep -ir clientalive /etc/ssh/sshd_config*
```

**Fix:**  
Configure the Ubuntu operating system to automatically terminate all network connections associated with SSH traffic at the end of a session or after a 10-minute period of inactivity.
```bash
# Modify or append the following line in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" file replacing "[Interval]" with a value of "600" or less:
ClientAliveInterval 600

# Restart the SSH daemon for the changes to take effect:
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service
```

**Audit:**  
Verify the Ubuntu operating system displays the Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the Ubuntu operating system via an SSH logon with the following command:

```bash
grep -ir banner /etc/ssh/sshd_config*
cat /etc/issue.net
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Set the parameter Banner in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" to point to the "/etc/issue.net" file:
sudo sed -i '/^Banner/d' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo sed -i '$aBanner /etc/issue.net' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Either create the file containing the banner or replace the text in the file. `/etc/issue.net`
> "You are accessing an Information System that is provided for authorized use only."

Restart the SSH daemon for the changes to take effect and then signal the SSH server to reload the configuration file:
```bash
sudo systemctl -s SIGHUP kill sshd
```

## File system permissions

**Audit:**  
Verify the Ubuntu operating system defines default permissions for all authenticated users with the following command:

```bash
grep -i "umask" /etc/login.defs
```

**Fix:**
> If the value of "UMASK" is not set to "077", is commented out, or is missing completely
```bash
# Edit the "UMASK" parameter in the "/etc/login.defs" file to match the example below:
UMASK 077
```
