# Zettelkasten

A zettelkasten is a method of taking notes and organizing information using 
index cards or digital notes. The notes are linked together using 
cross-referencing and can be easily retrieved and connected to other 
information. The system is designed to help with writing, research, and 
problem-solving. It is based on the principles of active recall, which
encourages users to engage with the information they are taking notes on,
rather than passively consuming it.
